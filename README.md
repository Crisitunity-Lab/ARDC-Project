# Crisis Management
Crisis management is a complex problem to which responses have real world impacts. Often much of the data that is provided in a crsis is unstructured making it hard to retieve meaningful information; information that could be used by authorities and agencies to provide better services and care. This project aims to take unstructured data, generated during a crisis, and generate meaningful information. 

## Dataset
For this project the CrisisLexT26 dataset was used (Olteanu et al, 2015). This data is publicly available from [here](https://github.com/sajao/CrisisLex/blob/master/releases/CrisisLexT26-v1.0.zip?raw=true).The dataset contains ~28,000 labelled tweets from 26 crisis events that occurred in 2012 and 2013. Tweets were labelled with informativeness, information type and information source using crowdsourcing.
