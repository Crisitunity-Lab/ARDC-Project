# Crisis Management
Crisis management is a complex problem to which responses have real world impacts. Often much of the data that is provided in a crsis is unstructured making it hard to retieve meaningful information; information that could be used by authorities and agencies to provide better services and care. This project aims to take unstructured data generated during a crisis and generate meaningful information.
